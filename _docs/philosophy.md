The AsyncDisplayKit team is motivated to help developers create world class apps with less code. 

##Supporting World Class Apps

We believe that a great app should deliver a great experience to every user - across all devices and on all network connections. 

Developers with apps serving international audiences make up a large part of the community as ASDK's asynchronous and concurrent performance gains allow you to easily render complex language scripts, on older devices, even on slower network connections.  

Our recent acessibiliity features make sure that users who require assistence receive a superior experience as well. 

##A Great Developer Experience

We also strive to make the developer experience great:

- **Objective-C** and **Swift** compatible
- requires fewer lines of code to build advanced apps (see <a href = "https://github.com/facebook/AsyncDisplayKit/tree/master/examples/ASDKgram">`examples/ASDKgram`</a> for a direct comparison of a UIKit implemention of an app vs. an equivalent ASDK implementation)
- cleaner architecture patterns
- robust code

##Advanced Developer Tools

As ASDK has grown, some of the brightest iOS engineers have contributed advanced technologies that will save you, as a developer using ASDK, development time. 

Our advanced technologies include:
- ASRunLoopQueue
- ASRangeController with Intelligent Preloading
- automatic batch fetching (e.g. JSON payloads)
