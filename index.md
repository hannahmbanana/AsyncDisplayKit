    <p>AsyncDisplayKit is an iOS framework that keeps even the most complex user
    interfaces smooth and responsive.  It was originally built to make Facebook's Paper app possible and now powers over 5,000 apps worldwide, including large scale development projects like Facebook's Instant Articles and the Pinterest app.</p> 
    
    <p>We are motivated by helping developers have more polished apps with less code.</p>

    <p>As the framework has grown, any advanced features that developers are used to having to build on their own have been added. Our developers have found that AsyncDisplyKit allows simplifications in their architecture and improves developer velocity. 
    
      If you've ever dealt with cell reuse bugs, tried to performantly preload data for a page or scroll style interface or even just tried to keep your app from dropping too many frames you can benefit from integrating ASDK.</p>
